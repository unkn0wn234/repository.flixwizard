description="KodiFlix Lite, less widgets to lessen load. Wouldn't reccomend Titan Bingie Mod for lower end devices regardless but feel free to give this a try. No Anime as a result of making this theme after the NoAnime one but Kaito is still there. Didn't merge the AutoWidget paths I removed so you can do it yourself or just leave it alone."
